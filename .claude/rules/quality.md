# Quality

- **Modular over monolith** - Use `zombie_quest/` package, not legacy `zombie_quest.py`
- **Game feel matters** - Test changes by playing, not just running
- **1982 authenticity** - Music, slang, venues should be period-accurate
- **Small commits** - Game code is fragile; isolate changes
