# Neon Dead Quest: Minneapolis '82

A retro point-and-click adventure built with Pygame that remixes Sierra-style exploration with the alternative rock explosion of Minneapolis in 1982. Trade tapes, dodge scene zombies, and earn your way backstage at First Avenue before the undead crowd steals the spotlight.

## Features

### 🎸 Alt-Rock Adventure
- Explore a four-scene slice of downtown Minneapolis: Hennepin Avenue, Let It Be Records, the KJRR college radio bunker, and First Avenue's backstage.
- Converse with scene denizens (living and undead) using classic WALK / LOOK / USE / TALK verbs.
- Snag era-authentic items like gig flyers, demo tapes, and coveted backstage passes.

### 🧟‍♀️ Scene Zombies
- Animated "scene zombie" NPCs wander each room, giving the world a living (unliving?) pulse.
- Retro priority masks let characters disappear behind scenery just like a King's Quest vignette.

### 🎛️ Inventory & Hotspot System
- Drag-and-drop inspired inventory that lets you select items before using them on hotspots.
- Contextual feedback for success, failure, and flavor interactions to encourage experimentation.
- Data-driven JSON layout so rooms, hotspots, and items can be remixed without touching code.

### 🌈 Synthwave Visual Toolkit
- Procedural neon gradients, skyline silhouettes, and signage accents crafted entirely from code.
- Directional placeholder animations labeled with the character's facing direction for easy debugging.
- Message box and verb bar tuned to evoke CRT glow and Minneapolis nightlife.

## Running the Game

```bash

python main.py
```

Use `python main.py --headless` to run a brief validation loop without opening a window (helpful for automated checks).

## File Structure Highlights

- `game_data.json` – defines rooms, hotspots, and items in the Minneapolis alt-rock storyline.
- `zombie_quest/engine.py` – Pygame loop, input handling, and new room transition logic.
- `zombie_quest/resources.py` – procedural neon art generator for backgrounds, sprites, and UI.
- `zombie_quest/rooms.py` – room, hotspot, and pathfinding primitives with new transition metadata.

## Credits & Inspiration

Designed as a loving riff on Sierra's SCI-era adventures, Minneapolis' alternative rock history, and every basement demo tape that ever warped in a backpack.
