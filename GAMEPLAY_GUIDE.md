## Item Combinations

### Musical Items Usage

Musical items don't combine but have different effects on zombies:

| Item | Best Used On | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Guitar Pick** | Rockers, Bouncers | Makes them dance or remember |
| **Demo Tape** | Scene Kids, DJs | Entrances them |
| **Setlist** | All Types | Mild calming effect |
| **Vinyl Record** | All Types | Strongest effect overall |

### Strategic Item Use

**Scenario**: Surrounded by multiple zombie types

**Solution**:
1. Identify zombie types (Scene, Bouncer, Rocker, DJ)
2. Use Vinyl Record for area-wide effect
3. Or use type-specific items for targeted pacification

**Tip**: Musical items create temporary zones. Effects wear off after a few seconds!

---

## Music Mechanics

### How Music Affects Zombies

Music creates **invisible zones** around the player when a musical item is used:

1. **Radius**: Each item has a different effective radius
2. **Intensity**: Distance from source reduces intensity
3. **Affinity**: Each zombie type has preferences
4. **Duration**: Effects last 3-5 seconds

### Music State Transitions

```
Hostile → Entranced → Dancing → Remembering
  ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
Red       Yellow      Green      Blue
```

### Optimal Music Strategy

**Safe Passage**:
- Use Vinyl Record for mixed zombie groups
- Use type-specific items for single zombies
- Wait for music effect, then move through

**Conservation**:
- Musical items are reusable
- No inventory limit on usage
- Use strategically to preserve health
